Usage: screen-session regions [options]
       scs r
       :bind X at 0 exec scs regions

Display a number in each region.
Allows selecting, swapping and rotating. Inspired by tmux display-panes.
Requires an active layout.

Keys:
goto region  - number and [g] or ['] or [space]
swap regions - number and [s]
rotate left  - number and [l]
rotate right - number and [r]

reverse goto region     - number and [G]

"""

Usage: screen-session kill [options] [signal=TERM] [window=current]
       scs K

Kill last process started in a window.
Useful for closing random emacs/vim instances and hung up ssh clients.
WARNING: sending KILL signal to the current window may crash Screen.

Options:
-t [tty device]

Example:
scs kill TERM 3
"""

help_kill_zombie = """\
Usage: screen-session kill-zombie [options] [group_ids]
       scs kz

Kill all zombie windows in session. Optionally specify target groups.\
"""

help_kill_group = """\
Usage: screen-session kill-group [options] [groupNum0] [groupNum..]
       scs kg

Recursively kill groups and windows inside.
Accepts titles and window numbers as arguments.
A dot "." selects current window, 2 dots ".."  select current group.
Take extra care with this command.\
"""

help_new_window = """\
Usage: screen-session new-window [options] [program]
       scs new
       scs nw
       :bind c eval "colon" "stuff \\"at 0 exec scs new-window \\""
       :bind -k k5 at 0 exec scs new-window -a0 key_F5

Start a new Screen window with the same working directory as the current window.

Options:
-d [dir]       - specify the working directory
-t [title]     - specify the title
-g [group]     - set the group
-n [win_num]   - set the window number
-N             - automatically set the new window number to (current number + 1)
-m [win_num]   - specify the source window
-D [dir]       - specify the directory used with -a (default: $HOME/.alter)
-a [position]  - prepend a directory specified with -D and current directory to
                 [program], useful for making directory specific keybindings

e.g. while current working directory is set to "/tmp"

:bind -k k5 at 0 exec scs new-window -a0 key_F5
is almost like
:bind -k k5 at 0 exec scs new-window $HOME/.alter/tmp/key_F5

:bind -k k5 at 0 exec scs new-window -a1 $EDITOR key_F5
is almost like
:bind -k k5 at 0 exec scs new-window $EDITOR $HOME/.alter/tmp/key_F5

If the -a flag was set then, before creating a new window, the script
tests whether the generated path exists and climbs the directory tree
if the file was not found. If the root is reached and no file was found
the path will be set to the first tested path.

An example "key_F5" script, which opens a new window inside "NOTIFY" group
and tries to raise a window running "inotail -f .*". If no matching window
was found, it will execute the command.

#!/bin/sh
scs nw -g NOTIFY scs run-or-raise-and-quit inotail -f $HOME/.screen_messages
screen -p $WINDOW -X kill\

Options:
-P   - do not show pid data
-r   - reverse the output
-s   - sort by window number\
"""

_help_find_pid = """\

Usage: screen-session layoutlist [options] [HEIGHT]
       scs ll
       :bind l at 0 exec scs layoutlist -l -c 20

Displays a browseable list of layouts. There are two list creation algorithms.
If HEIGHT != 0, an alternative list creation algorithm is used. Layout numbers
are modulo divided by HEIGHT and the reminder determines their Y position.
This tool comes handy after raising the maximum number of layouts 
(see ":maxlay" Screen command).

Options:
-a [min_len=2]  - minimum matching charecters for auto highlight,
                  min_len = 0 disables auto highlight
-c              - do not terminate layoutlist after selecting a layout
                  or reselect a running layoutlist, best used with "-l" option,
                  there should be running only one layoutlist started with "-c"
                  per session
-l              - create a temporary layout and window for layoutlist
-M              - select previous layout and exit
-p              - run layout-checkpoint before activating layoutlist
-w              - create a temporary window for layoutlist
-t [width=11]   - set title width

Keys:
?               - display help
ENTER           - confirm / select
ARROWS and hjkl - movement
/ or SPACE      - start searching layout titles
n and p         - next / previous search result
NUMBER          - move to a layout
r or C-c or C-l - refresh the layout list
m or a          - toggle MRU view,
v               - toggle search/autohighlight results view
o               - toggle current and selected layouts
q               - quit / select previous layout
Q               - force quit if "-c" option was used

Note: If you are using -c and -l options and layoutlist stopped working
      properly, then delete the temporary directory:
      /tmp/screen-session-$USER/___layoutlist
